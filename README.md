# üëã About Me

<h3>Hi there!</h3>

I am a **Full-Stack Developer** with expertise in both **Front-End and Back-End Development**. On the front-end, I work with **React.js, Next.js, and JavaScript**, focusing on building dynamic, responsive, and optimized user interfaces. On the back-end, I have experience with **Node.js, Express.js, Python (Django, Flask)**, where I develop scalable APIs, authentication systems, and database-driven applications. I work with **both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Supabase)** for efficient data management.  

I am also passionate about **Data Analytics and Machine Learning**, leveraging **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn** to analyze data and build predictive models. My development workflow often includes **Git, Docker, and cloud deployments** to ensure scalability and efficiency. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and exploring new technologies to build robust and scalable solutions.
